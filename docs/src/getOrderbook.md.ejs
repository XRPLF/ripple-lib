## getOrderbook (deprecated)

`getOrderbook(address: string, orderbook: object, options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns open orders for the specified account. Open orders are orders that have not yet been fully executed and are still in the order book.

**DEPRECATED:** Orders returned by this method are not sorted correctly (see [issue #766](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib/issues/766)). Use `request` and [`formatBidsAndAsks`](#formatbidsandasks) instead.

### Parameters

<%- renderSchema('input/get-orderbook.json') %>

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure (Note: the structures of `bids` and `asks` are identical):

<%- renderSchema('output/get-orderbook.json') %>

**Raw order data:** The response includes a `data` property containing the raw order data. This may include `owner_funds`, `Flags`, and other fields.

For details, see the rippled method [book_offers](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#book-offers).

### Example

```javascript
const address = 'r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59';
const orderbook = <%- importFile('test/fixtures/requests/get-orderbook.json') %>;
return api.getOrderbook(address, orderbook)
  .then(orderbook => {/* ... */});
```

<%- renderFixture('responses/get-orderbook.json') %>
