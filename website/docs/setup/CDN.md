# Using xrpl.js from a CDN

You can avoid setting up your build system to handle `xrpl.js` by using a cdn version that is prebuilt for the browser.

- unpkg `<script src="https://unpkg.com/xrpl@2.3.0/build/xrpl-latest-min.js"></script>`
- jsdelivr `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/xrpl@2.3.0/build/xrpl-latest-min.js"></script>`

Ensure that the full path is provided so the browser can find the sourcemaps.
